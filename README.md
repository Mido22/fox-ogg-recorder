# fox-ogg-recorder

Mozilla firefox ogg/wav/mp3 audio recorder.

Note: This uses Firefox's [MediaRecorder API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaRecorder), so would work only in firefox

also, if you are going to do a one-shot recording( no uploading chunks at intervals) and want only in `ogg` format, then there is no dependency on `nodejs` or `ffmpeg`. you could just download the project and click on `index.html` and test.
